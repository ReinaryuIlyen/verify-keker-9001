Cygames hates you, so let your computer yell at you when playing their shitty game

How it works? 

It searches for all images inside the Assets/ folder, so you can change to anything (captcha, new verify) - Just make sure to always have Verify1-Verify10.png
1) Run the exe program 
2) Play gbf
3) If it sees any images that looks like a verification button on display, program beep nonstop until you hit 'esc' or exit it from task manager
4) Once you pass the verification, rerun the program to set it up for the next verification .

This is intended to prevent people who are too tired or drunk while playing gbf, from making verification mistakes and get hyper banned.


AutoIt bloats exe's, that's why it's huge. You can run the script directly through AutoIt if you're worried
